# Smart-Shelf-Monitoring-System
## Smart Shelf Monitoring System

This is my final year IoT project for BSc (Hons) in Computing.  
It uses an Arduino Nano 33 IoT, push-button sensors, and ThingSpeak to track stock levels on shelves in real time.

### Features
- Push-button sensor detection
- Real-time updates to ThingSpeak
- Email alerts using PushingBox
- MATLAB-based pie chart for shelf visualisation

### Files
- `smart_shelf_monitor.ino` – Main Arduino code
- `secrets_template.h` – Wi-Fi & API placeholder
- `pie_chart.m` – MATLAB script for pie chart
